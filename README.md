## PR Strategy

0. **Master should be stable at ALL times**
1. Small commits -> Push directly to master, no need of PR (purposely allowing this to build trust and confidence!)
2. New features -> Make feature branch, PR with master, merge with master. 
3. One more features ready for relase -> Merge with release, will be auto-deployed and show up quite soon
4. Super urgent stuff -> No need for PR. Push to master

Avanti mein master and release are protected and all. But I think, trust ke saat kaam karna zyaada important hai. So we should have the power to push directly, we just shouldn't use it unless absolutely necessary.

Yeh clear hai?
